I've been making websites in one form or another since I was about 12 years old. Early on, websites were made with tables. And when I was 12 I was doing the same, only I was using real tables, tables in Excel. Excel was the closest I could figure out how to make something that looked like a website. I recreated sites I knew, like Yahoo, designing navigation and the basic structures. Then I latter moved up to using Keynote to recreate blogs and planned my media empire. I learned HTML and CSS when I was 15, after getting a book on the matter. Since then I've learnt a thing or two, have made quite a few sites, and now, I'm launching my internet home: notnotjake.com

I hope to be able to build upon this foundation to launch a career in product.
