title: Draft Post
---
This is a *sample draft post*. Drafts aren't gonna show up in the collections of [posts](/posts/). They can be found at a modified address: `posts/drafts/year/title-slug`.

This is useful to look at writing in it's final form as this helps with editing. There are currently no methods for scheduling a post to go out. It would probably be possible to rig something up, but I think that would go against the spirit of 11ty.
