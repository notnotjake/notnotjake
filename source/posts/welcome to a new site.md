I have so much I want to create and share and I've created this site to help me do that. There are a lot of websites, but this one is mine.

I've been making websites in one form or another since I was around 12 years old. I started out with Excel (which was close to how site's were made at that time), recreating Yahoo's home page and other primitive websites. Later, I got an iMac and used Keynote to mockup tech news sites, inspired by The Verge and Polygon. Finally, I started making sites for real with HTML and CSS. I've always loved the medium of the web, and I'm happy to have a place to call home.

I'm sharing my goal prominently; to create delightful and meaningful experiences. I want to share my thoughts, research, opinions and inspirations here.</br>
But ultimately my goal is about **making it real**. Creating something new and vibrant that people can experience and find delightful and meaningful.

So stick around and follow along on this journey!
