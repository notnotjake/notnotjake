		<h2>Where Does the Future Come From?</h2>
		
		<p>It's easy to get caught up in the everyday tasks of life. For days or even months, one can become a cog in the machinery of life, unable or unwilling to recognize this precarious position. When one loses their sense of agency, their sense of purpose, the world is in danger.</p>
		
		<p>Each person on this planet is unique. Not just now, but across all of time. Each person has unique thoughts, emotions, and experiences and a unique view of the world. Every individual has something unique and important to contribute to the world - and a profound responsibility to do so. To lose one's sense of purpose and agency is a loss for the entire world.</p>
		
		<p>Where does the future come from? One answer, derived from the greek <em>'Futurus'</em>, is that the future is an extension of the past. This is useful for accountants. Next years sales will likely follow the trend of the years prior. However, this hardly predicts such amazing events as Apollo landing on the Moon, or such terrible things as the Holocaust. While seeds of these events lay in the past, no amount of historical knowledge would have predicted their occurrence.</p>
		
		<p>So then where does the future come from? <em>'Adventus'</em> is greek for a future which is arriving, and coming towards us. <em>This</em> future is open, unknown, and shaped by those individuals willing to confront it.</p>
		
		<p>A future shaped by the past is not an exciting future. It's not a future that I want. A future shaped by bright, unique individuals, aiming for the highest good is an exciting future! It's the future we should aspire to.
		— exciting is a bad argument. things dont need to be exciting, they should be good. encouraging.</p>
		
		<p>My purpose in life is to help create such a future. Both in my own work and through inspiring others. What I can do is only so much, but by inspiring others, the future becomes exponentially brighter.</p>
		
		<p>My goal is to create delightful and meaningful experiences.</p>

		<p class="focused">To impact the world one can create or destroy. Destruction can be a noble act, but rarely. Far more impactful is creating something. To add something to the world - to give something back - is “to show your deep appreciation” for the species as Steve Jobs said.</p>
		
		<p>Life is too short not to be enjoyed. I want to create experiences which lift the human spirit. Something that’s delightful is often also surprising. Delight has the ability to shake one out of their hum-drum state of mind, inspire them, and spark new life. This is what I aspire to.</p>
		
		<p>To truly have a positive impact, delight needs to be paired with meaning, otherwise it’s easy to fall to simple pleasure.</p>
		
		<p>Movement and growth are life, so the question is whether what I do moves people in a positive direction or a negative one over a long term.</p>
		
		<p>Everything I want to create - apps, art, businesses, homes - are ultimately about experiences. The product exists dead, animated and given life by those who _experience_ it. A beautiful home has no meaning until someone is able to experience it.</p>
		
		<p>I’m not against creating for creating sake - that’s art! But what I find more important is to create work which others will experience. No matter what medium your work is in, it ultimately becomes *someone else’s experience*.</p>
