Apple Music is a *fantastic product for enjoying* music.
I switched over from Spotify when Apple Music [launched]() and have loved it ever since.

Music is vital to me. As I see it, there are three things I focus on.
1. Building a collection of great music
2. Exploring the diverse expanse of music
3. Staying on top of new music

I want to share some ways to get more out of your listening time. One thing that's great about Apple Music is that there are tons of apps on the App Store that can integrate with Apple Music and really improve the experience. In addition, I've built some [Shortcuts]() and practices that you might find useful.

# Seasonal Music Playlists
One of the distinctions I make is between music I'm enjoying _now_ and music that I think deserves to be part of my collection. I used to add any song I liked to my Library. The problem was that browsing or shuffling through my Library months later, I didn't really care for them anymore and didn't think they deserved to be a part of my Music Collection.

My solution was to **create seasonal playlists**. Each season I create a new playlist, and for a few months I add the music I'm enjoying. It's a mix of new music and music I'm coming back to and enjoying. These playlists are kind of a record of what I'm going through.

Last winter's playlist had more rock and dark music and some from The Batman. Later if I go back I'm able to remember how I was feeling and access some of the nostalgia of that time; like [The Avalanches]() that summer I went to New York for the first time - it's in [a playlist]().

### Limitations

There are a few downsides. First, I/O: there are two USB-C thunderbolt 3 ports on both of the new laptops and the Mac Mini loses its optional 10Gb Ethernet port. Second, they can only be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and start at 8GB. That seems plenty adequate for these base machines and Apple will surely improve in both of these areas with the next release of _mid_-tier Macs. I'm guessing that will happen at WWDC with a 16” MacBook Pro which is a developer favorite alongside the iMac.
</br>To sort them by year I rename them to 'X-78' where the number is `100 - the year`. So for my playlists from the year 2022, they become `100 - 22 = 78` → 'X-78'. This gets them to sort in decending order from newest to oldest.

### Presentation

My second set of complaints are about the presentation itself. I'm not a big fan of the virtual keynotes. They feel over produced and too much like a commercial. Craig Federighi pulls it off best, but still, the live events were more fun and personable. Apple is continuing to give less and less details in their presentations as well. They make claims like 2x faster which begs the questions, “than what?” and “at what?”. I don’t doubt these to be extremely performant but Apple’s extremely opaque claims make average onlookers more skeptical and make me, well, annoyed I guess. Just another austere, user-hostile move in the Cook era.

## Playlist Folders
From the Mac you can create Playlist Folders. You could create a 'Moods' folder and put all your playlists built around a mood into this folder. On iOS, in Playlists if you sort by Type, these folders will show up after Apple Music playlists and before your Playlists, so they get some priority over your other playlists. For that reason, I don't think I'm gonna keep using them.

## Markdown Features
Markdown has a number of features which need to be tested. Your playlists built around a mood into this folder.

For that reason, I don't think I'm gonna keep using them.

2. Unordered Lists (*similar, but without numbers*)
