I've been making websites in one form or another since I was around 12 years old. I started out with Excel (not far from how site's were made at that time), recreating Yahoo's home page and other primitive web apps. Later, I got an iMac and used Keynote to mockup tech news sites, inspired by The Verge and Polygon. Finally, I started making sites for real with HTML and CSS. I've always loved the medium of the web, and today am launching a new home for myself here.

I've had this domain for a couple years and previously had something up, but it was a site without a purpose.
