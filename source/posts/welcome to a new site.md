Hey there! Happy to have you.

I'm Jake. I've been making websites in one form or another since I was around 12 years old. It started with Excel ([which is basically how site's were made then](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/tables-layout-absurd/)), just recreating sites I knew. Later, I got a Mac and used Keynote to make websites, app mockups, and some graphic design. But finally, I started making sites for real. 
</br>I've always loved the medium of the web, and I'm happy to have a place here to call home.

### Why Build a Site?
I've put a lot of care into this site and I hope it's evident and appreciated. Why put so much time and care into a site? Why not just post on the growing and constantly changing list of Platforms?



## Site Details
There's a homepage, posts, and there are boutique pages. It's a static site, built with 11ty and hosted on Netlify.

One feature I'm quite happy with is the auto-scrolling 'marquee' at the top of the home page. I didn't want a traditional news feed like a blog, but still wanted to highlight new stuff, so a marquee seemed fitting. There are many sites doing standard marquees that are simply animated to move horizontally. But I wanted an interruptible marquee. When you put your mouse over it, it should pause. Okay, just use a `:hover` pseudo and stop the animation? Well, no because I also want to be able to scroll with touch/trackpad through the list, then naturally restart the animation from where you stop. It does! I plan to write up and share how I did this to save you some time.

Another little detail is my footend section. I think it's quite pretty in dark and light modes. But it has a few little details I'd like to highlight.

Lastly, I made what I call a *Splash Animation*: something that plays the first time you visit a site and is like a little welcome animation; a little splash of personality. You may not have seen it if you haven't visited the homepage[â†’](/). And if you missed it, you can check out [My Goal](/goal) which plays the animation every time.

In Summary: there're a lot of websites, but this one is mine.

## Content
I must admit I love the craft and I over-obsess on *presentation*. In the final analysis, content is what wins. There's content with terrible formatting that has more impact and attention than I may ever receive. So it goes.

What you may find, on this site, in the future:
- My work
- Reviews of tech, kitchen wares, clothes
- Thoughts on news, new ideas, and the current moment
- New ideas about the future
- Books I like and what I got from them

I'm sharing my goal prominently; to create delightful and meaningful experiences. I want to share my thoughts, research, opinions and inspirations here.
</br>But ultimately my goal is about **making it real**. Creating something new and vibrant that people can experience and find delightful and meaningful.

So stick around and follow along on this journey!
