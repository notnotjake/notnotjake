I was in college for 9 semesters and each one of them started with me telling myself that this was gonna be the one where I really got it together. Where I did everything I'd wanted to do. Where I got organized and really did my best. Where I got on a good schedule and did all those good, healthy habits.

Maybe there's something about school and college that really make you feel this sense of loss. Ferris Bueller is one of my favorite movies and it's about this same idea. "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop every once in a while, you might miss it." I think looking back at school and college really accentuates to yourself what you missed out on. Of course, you'll never do it all - that's impossible. But you could feel fulfilled, without regrets that you missed something. I did have some incredibly great times in college. But I feel I didn't take advantage of every moment.
